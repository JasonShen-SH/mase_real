# Regression Model Generation from HLS Components

This folder contains a Python-based code generator for emitting HLS components in C.
The exploration toolchain explores an HLS component with different design constraints and returns a regression model for performance and area estimation. 

```sh
python3 hls_regression.py --op=int_linear2d --mode all --dir dse_linear2d
```
