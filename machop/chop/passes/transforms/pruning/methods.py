Pruning methods (incl. add-ons)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Internal Backlog:
1. The benefit of the adaptive strategy is that you directly control the minimum
   sparsity in activations. A neat extension would be to save the thresholds that it
   generates via a forward pass (invoking the hook on a representative batch) and use
   it for a fixed-layerwise strategy. It doesn't guarantee the minimum sparsity, but
   it's close enough.
